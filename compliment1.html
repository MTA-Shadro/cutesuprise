            Sbeh lfoll azizti, I hope you slept well. ❤️<br><br>
            Takwouchti lghalya, I wanna let you know eli I appreciate you alekhr.  
            W I’m very happy to know you, and I’m lucky to be close to you.  
            I always wanna get closer because ya azizti you have such heavenly eyes and a demonic aura.  
            I would give you my soul on the altar babygirl. ❤️😇<br><br>
            I appreciate every detail of you. I like your kindness, your light-hearted jokes, your silly demeanor, your intelligence, your eyes, your sweet cheeks, your big boobs and beautiful areolas and nipples, your pretty shiny hair, your height and your mommy treatment especially when you hug me and lay my head on your sweet bossom, your tender touch and your perfect skin, your sweet tempting moans (music to my ears 🥰), your cute belly and the shape of your waist.<br><br>
            Azizti you’re one of a kind and you are rarer than an emerald. You are such a gem.<br><br>
            I love the overshadowing of your pretty mascara on them almond-shaped eyes, so precious, they’re an entire warzone 😩 and I’m the field commander of the army ❤️ I get lost in them every time I see you.<br><br>
            Again, rabbi ykhalik leya, and I hope for this bond between us to develop more. And I hope you feel the same.
