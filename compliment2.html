            Your pretty long hair is sooo majestic, and your almond-shaped eyes?  
            They’re more divine than any Greek Goddess.  
            They’re the kind of eyes that pull you in, deep and unreadable,  
            like they’re hiding secrets worth discovering (I will conquer them tomorrow ba3d cha9an lfatr 🥰🪖)<br><br>
            Your eyeliner is a weapon of mass destruction, wars would be fought for it.  
            « You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people, you’re gambling with world war 3. »<br><br>
            And don’t even get me started on your eyebrows—absolutely perfect.  
            And that cute nose? Just unfair at this point.<br><br>
            But your lips… my holy God. They’re something else—both tempting and commanding, like they know they hold power.<br><br>
            And I absolutely LOVE your outfit, the choice of your white top with jeans is so well-thought  
            khater you’re white like an angel, ema you seduce me more than the devil. 💝<br><br>
            How am I supposed to fast now?🥰  
            Any jealous bitch would perish in your presence.  
            You’re the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
